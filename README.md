# Forest Fire detection with Machine Learning on Edge Devices.
Wildfire detection on edge devices using Tensorflow and OpenVINO

Wildfires are unplanned and unwanted fires, including lightning-caused fires, unauthorized human-caused fires, and escaped prescribed fire projects.

Just from my country I can share the following statistics:
* Wildfires devastate a total of 22,132 hectares of forests in 2019
* By February 10 of this month, 17 fires have been reported in the country.

In one of the most recent catastrophies, this Forest Fires in Austrilia have destroy at least 11 million hectares, killing millions of animals and at least 33 people have died.
